Wine Tasting - Discover Southern France
Participatory Event


Welcome to Cambridgeshire Wine School! Join us at our Discover Southern France evening exploring star producers of the Mediterranean, one of the few places in France where you may find the grape variety helpfully listed on the label!

It doesn't get more laid back and maverick than this - Languedoc is potentially one of the most fascinating areas of France, filled with quality producers opting out of the official system and doing their own thing! 
There has been a big drive towards organic and biodynamic vineyard practices in southern France so we will be exploring the difference this can make to wine. And we'll sample wine made by French celebrity producers (e.g. a former international rugby player now considered a national hero). But most of all it's the diversity on offer you'll notice - this is the region producing the most French wine!

This wine tasting evening also makes a great gift voucher idea for only £25.

SAVE £15 by booking this evening along with 3 others on the 4-week Grand Tour de France! It's flexible (we can credit you if you need to skip an evening) and you pay just £45 to reserve + £10 each night!

All tastings include at least six wines, sourced locally so you can find them easily if you like them, tasting notes, tutored tasting and use of professional tasting glasses.

This evening takes place at the Cambridge City Hotel, Downing St (see Our Venues page).

SAVE £30! Our 8-week course saves £30 against the cost of buying 8 seperate evenings, you pay half the fee upfront and £10 each night (so if you can't make it last minute you don't lose the full price of the evening) and if you need to skip a session and can give us at least 1 week's notice we credit you so you can pick it up the next time it runs! A truly flexible way to learn about the world of wine!
