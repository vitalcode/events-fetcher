About this concert
Austrian mezzo-soprano Angelika Kirchschlager joins us for a performance of the recital and operatic music for which she has gained worldwide admiration.

The evening includes with three Mozart lieder whose intimate introspection would inspire Schumann and Schubert. Mozart and Haydn also explored the colourful potential of opera, and –  alongside two Mozart concert arias – at the heart of the programme stands Haydn’s remarkable Scena di Berenice, a ten-minute operatic scene telling a tragic tale of lost love.

Richard Egarr plays a Haydn piano concerto, and the evening begins with Mozart's deft Symphony No.33.
