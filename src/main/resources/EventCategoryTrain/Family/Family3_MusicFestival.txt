Strawberry Fair is a member of the Association of Festival Organisers
From humble beginnings Strawberry Fair has grown to be the most popular free music and arts event in Cambridge. On the first Saturday of June for almost forty years, residents and visitors have gathered together on Midsummer Common to celebrate their vibrant and creative city.
What puts the Fair at the heart of Cambridge? 
The Fair is run entirely by volunteers (affectionately known as Strawberry Fairies) who give their energy, imagination and vision to present to their friends and neighbours in Cambridge a great free day out.
We're all about taking pride in our community and put the local at the heart of the Fair as much as possible. We are not-for-profit and non-political, independent and entirely self funding. Strawberry Fair is run by the community for the community. 
We love to see new faces among the Strawberry Fairies and need volunteers throughout the year to make the day of the Fair a success. Find out about volunteering with Strawberry Fair here.
Yes, but what IS Strawberry Fair?
Strawberry Fair is a visual and musical extravaganza for all the family, a jamboree for people of all ages. 
First and foremost, Strawberry Fair is a feast for music lovers. Throughout the Fair, all day you can enjoy an eclectic range of music from performers both local and from further afield.
We partner with locally based groups such as Cambridge Cinema Shorts, which runs Strawberry Shorts, the Fair's film festival; local samba band Arco Iris who set the streets dancing as the parade snakes its way through the city centre; and newcomers to the Fair the Cambridge Community Circus who thrill the crowds with their deftness and artistry. 
The Fair has community stalls where you can find out what local people are doing to make Cambridge a happy and happening city. And if you want to get your wallets out, there's crafts to buy and lots and lots of food to satisfy all tastes and appetites.
In Cambridge the Strawberry season starts early, with workshops, benefit gigs and of course the Cambridge Band Competition, which runs from January and throughout early spring. If you live in or around Cambridge, there are plenty of opportunities for you to create, perform and take part.
