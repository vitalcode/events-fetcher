Event  tutti frutti: Hue Boy

 
Hue Boy may be the smallest boy in his village but he is big news. Pumpkin soup and exercise... just some of the suggestions to make him grow.
This heart-warming storytelling performance transports you to a Caribbean village where one of tutti frutti´s most experienced performers, Stewart Thomas, brings to life this delightful book to children aged 3-7 and their families. With a vibrant set, original soundscape and visual movement style, the show is set in a beautiful environment under a parasol that creates a special place to enjoy this unique interactive experience.
