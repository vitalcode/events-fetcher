Best Paw Forward - Highgate



Historic Highgate Wood is the setting for a Sunday morning stroll with a difference. Meet like-minded people, take in the natural surroundings, have fun, and raise money towards the life-saving work of Cancer Research UK!

Bring along your perfect pooch and join us for a relaxing 4km stroll around our local Green Heritage site on Sunday 9 June 2013. Starting at 10am, the two laps of the wood will last around an hour and allow you to explore this lovely nature reserve. 

You can even make it a family outing by staying for afternoon cricket, the delightful children’s playground, or having Sunday lunch at a nearby pub. 

Registration is just £8 per dog and you will receive a pack giving you all the information you need about the walk and details of how to set up your dog’s own online Justgiving page.
To make the day a huge success, there is a recommended sponsorship target of £100 per entrant – with prizes for the highest fundraising hound!
