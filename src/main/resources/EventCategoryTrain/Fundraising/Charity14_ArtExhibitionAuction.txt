This year's Art Auction
 Due to many of my friends having had cancer, often terminal, I have decided to donate in order to express my gratitude for the wonderful support system of Macmillan.

Macmillan and De’Longhi are joining forces again to host the seventh annual Macmillan De’Longhi Art Auction. 

This year's event will be held over 5 days and will include a public exhibition at the prestigous Royal College of Art; in previous years artists such as Antony Gormley, Rankin, Tracey Emin and Gavin Turk have all donated their work featured.

The money raised on the evening will help support people affected by cancer through funding services such as information and support centres, phone services, cancer care centres, as well as nurses and other specialist health care professionals.
