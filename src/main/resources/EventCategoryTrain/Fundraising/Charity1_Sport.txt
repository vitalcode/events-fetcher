London to Cambridge Charity Bike Ride


The London to Cambridge charity bike ride is an annual event that has been taking place since 1997 and is organised by Bike Events - the UK’s largest organizer of fund raising and recreational cycle rides. Thousands of cyclists take part in the event each year and raise valuable funds through sponsorship in support of the official partner charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Many riders attend year after year and ride for friends or family who have been directly affected by cancer. The ride also benefits from huge support from local and national businesses - Olympic gold medallist Sally Gunnell led the way for the Waitrose team in 2011.

The 60 mile route starts at Pickett's Lock in north London, from where it winds through the beautiful rolling landscape of Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire to the finish at Midsummer Common in the heart of historic Cambridge. Enroute cyclists pass through balmy cornfields, can stop for lunch at country pubs and enjoy making friends on this gentle and pleasant ride. At Midsummer Common riders are met with music from two live bands, lots of great refreshment stalls and a big top. There are refreshment stops at regular intervals throughout the ride and Bike Events provide full back-up, including route-signing, marshals, medics, mechanics and support vehicles.

Over 50,000 women and 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Breakthrough Breast Cancer’s mission is to save lives through improving early diagnosis, developing new treatments and preventing all types of breast cancer. They are getting closer to our goals, but are relying on their supporters to help them get there. The £3 million raised by the London to Cambridge Bike Ride up to 2012 funded all of Breakthrough’s life-saving work for almost a year.
