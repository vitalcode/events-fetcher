New event brings Peterborough Museum to life!


Discover the remarkable history of the building that now houses Peterborough Museum in a weekend of family fun and events on 11-12 May, from 10am-5pm.


With origins in the Tudor period, the site certainly has a long and varied history! Take a tour of the Tudor cellar that is not normally open to the public (book on arrival), meet Georgian aristocracy, and visit the Victorian doctor in the original Operating Theatre.
 
Plus don’t miss the opportunity to meet the hospital cook in the Victorian Kitchen, and experience the early days of Peterborough Museum in the 1930s. You can also discover the history of medicine in the museum garden.
