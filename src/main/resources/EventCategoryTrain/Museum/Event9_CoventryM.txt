999 - Emergency Vehicles Exhibition


General - Learning - Temporary Exhibition


This Spring, Coventry Transport Museum will be alive with the sights and sounds of the ‘blues and twos’, as our exciting temporary exhibition 999 showcases a variety of historical vehicles from all three of Britain’s emergency services. 

Experience an exhibition for all the family, with a wide range of emergency vehicles on display. Discover and learn about these fantastic life-saving machines, some of which were made right here in Coventry.   Come and see the fire engine that in the 1920s was stationed just across the road from where the Museum now stands, investigate the police car which acted as an incident control room and see one of the paramedic motorcycles from the TV programme  ‘Emergency Bikers’ plus many, many more! 

This special exhibition is perfect for a family day out - don't miss these special 'extra' activities:
