Today's generation of aspiring young musicians often have just one choice in their pursuit of a career to take the plunge and independently mastermind a digital cottage industry from which their songs can be discovered by a like-minded audience. That's precisely what Oxford's twenty-year-old singer-songwriter Lewis Watson did. After gradually building his own fan-base, his economically-produced debut EP 'It's Got Four Sad Songs On It BTW' topped the iTunes singer-songwriter chart on the first day of release, outselling the likes of Adele, Madonna and Ed Sheeran in the process. It's a model that plenty of artists aspire to recreate, but few ever make any serious progress with.
