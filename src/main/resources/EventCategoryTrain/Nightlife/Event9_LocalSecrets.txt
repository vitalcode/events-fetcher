Green Door is launching in Cambridge with its first party on Sunday 26 May at La Raza. It will host four parties a year, promising a night out like Cambridge has never seen before! Each will be held in a different location and have a different theme -only revealed on the day of the party. The Green Door will be your entry to all and the night will include a seven course tasting menu, top entertainment and DJs.
