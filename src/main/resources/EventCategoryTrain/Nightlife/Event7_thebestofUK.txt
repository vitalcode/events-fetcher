“His presence and intelligence make him one of the most brilliantly unpredictable comics in the country.” Sunday Times

“Reginald Hunter joins the top rank of stand-up comedians working today...a comedian going for broke, flying in the face of received opinion in a way that is simply exhilarating...this is comedy of a rare scope." The Times
 
Following two previous sell-out tours of the UK and the release of his debut stand up DVD, Reginald D Hunter Live, Reginald – who is a popular guest on many of the UK’s best-loved TV shows including Live At The Apollo and Have I Got News For You - will be setting out to tour the country again in 2013 with his own unique blend of humour in a brand new show, Reginald D Hunter – In The Midst Of Crackers.
