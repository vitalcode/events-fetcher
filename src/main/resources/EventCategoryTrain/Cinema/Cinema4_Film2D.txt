Synopsis
 
For this new adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s bittersweet novel set during New York’s gaudy jazz era, director Luhrmann (ROMEO + JULIET, MOULIN ROUGE!) has considerably upped the ante.
Arguably eclipsing Robert Redford’s portrayal in the 1974 version, Leonardo DiCaprio as the maverick millionaire Jay Gatsby was an inspired casting move; but dramatically enhancing the glitz and glamour of 1920s Manhattan by shooting it in 3D was a real masterstroke.
Add to that Mulligan (DRIVE) as Daisy, Gatsby’s sexy if unobtainable love interest, Edgerton (ZERO DARK THIRTY) as her philandering husband, and Maguire (SPIDER-MAN) as Nick Carraway, the impressionable hick-from-the sticks writer who witnesses the unravelling of a precarious status quo, and you have an epic parable of excess and its consequences.
