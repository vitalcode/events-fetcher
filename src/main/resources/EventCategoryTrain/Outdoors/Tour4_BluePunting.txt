CITY TOUR
(2 ½ hours – starting at 10:30am - approximately 4miles)

This is a great tour if you’re really pushed for time. It covers the majority of the sights and follows a squiggly line taking in Midsummer Common, Stourbridge Common, Eights Rowing, College Boat Houses, Jesus Green, Round Church (one of only four in the UK), Front of St. Johns College, Trinity Great Gate, Trinity Great Court (subject to side door being open), The Wren Library (subject to time), Garrett Hostel Bridge, Cambridge University Real Tennis Club, The Backs, The Best Spot to take that iconic photo of Kings College Chapel, Senate House, Kings Parade, Corpus Christi Clock, The Eagle Pub, St. Benets Church and Mill Pond.

We start under the lamp in the middle of Parker’s Piece just to the south of the City Centre at 10:30am. If you’re running a bit late don’t worry ... come straight to our office at No.6 Elm Street where we will be fitting bikes.

The tour will finish at the Mill Pond at around 1pm before returning the bikes. (When you watch the main tour group go off for the afternoon you’ll be wishing you were with them!)
