Private Punting Tour of The Backs
The number one tour on the river! This guided tour takes place in one of our intimate and traditional wooden punts.

We set off from Jesus Green and head upstream passing 7 colleges and 8 of their bridges including the bridge of Sighs at St. Johns College. We see the Wren library at Trinity College, Clare Bridge, The Silent Bridge, Kings College Chapel and The Wooden Bridge at Queens College, which people incorrectly refer to as The Mathematical Bridge. We’ve got some cracking stories of student pranks and life at The University. Truly a magical time.

Allow at least one hour.
