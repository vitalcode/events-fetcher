Blooming Marvellous! Don't miss Ely Cathedral Flower Festival

 

For four days in June, the magnificent mediaeval Cathedral in Ely will provide the perfect setting for the East of England’s largest flower festival. With the theme ‘In the Beginning’ a mass of flowers will transform the Cathedral’s interior into a stunning spectacle depicting the Creation. 


Over 75 displays will represent the land, sea, sun, moon and the many creatures associated with it.  A ‘river’ of water and flowers will snake down the Nave, culminating in spectacular displays under Ely Cathedral’s world famous Octagon Tower.  
 
In addition there will be displays representing each of the continents of the world and a special floral tribute, in the form of a life-size throne, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the coronation of Her Majesty the Queen. The Festival’s Creative Director is Chelsea gold medal winner, Roger Woolnough. 
 
“There is a great deal of excitement surrounding the event and we have been over whelmed by the enthusiasm of people wanting to get involved.  The floral displays will be magnificent and we hope the event will be memorable for everyone”.
 
Not only are there plenty of opportunities to volunteer at the Festival, there are also several spectacular displays that can be sponsored by businesses and individuals.  Coralie Green  says “The floral exhibits will be eye catching. Whether you are a local business wanting to be associated with such a high profile event or an individual who would like to sponsor a display in memory of a loved one, or in celebration of something, there are plenty of options to choose from – Just give us a call.”
 
Visitors to the Festival will also be able to enjoy musical performances and recitals, floral demonstrations and shopping in the Gift & Craft Marquee.  The Festival will offer plenty of opportunity to sit down for some refreshments including snacks, lunches, afternoon teas and a dedicated picnic area.
