A chance to meet the farmer & his animals....

...tractor & trailer rides, farm walks, a BBQ, beer tent, a visit from the RSPB & heaps of children's activities.

Our theme this year is perfect pork... so children will be able to meet the pigs (and hopefully some little piglets, too!), talk to the farmer about how they look after them, then have a fantastic time making their own sausages with expert help from chef Ursula Ferrigno.

From chipolatas to chorizo the world of the sausage is incredibly varied and versatile. Made with pure meat from our very happy pigs, Burwash Manor is famous for its sausages. They'll be grilling them on the barbeque for you to try, too!

There will also be demonstrations of sheep shearing, spinning, willow weaving, ferreting, bee-keeping and farm machinery (weather permitting they will be making silage).

11am until 4pm.
