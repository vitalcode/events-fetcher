Festival of Plants
The new Festival of Plants at the Cambridge University Botanic Garden brings together horticulture and science in a day devoted to all things plant, from propagation to pollination, from seed to shopping! Join our team of horticulturalists, plant experts and scientists from across the region for a garden event with a difference.

A range of events and exhibits timetabled throughout the day include ‘ask the gardener’ sessions, pop-up plant science demonstrations, and plant shopping along the Garden’s majestic Main Walk. Activity hubs make full use of the Garden, which is at its best in late spring with the Bee Borders, new Cory Lawn landscape and the Systematic Beds in full flower:

• Pop-up Plant Science
Find out how to extract plant pigments, take the
temperature of a leaf and discover how plants know
their ABC!

• Talking Plants
Bring all those gardening dilemmas and thorny pest
and disease issues to drop-in ‘ask the gardener’ sessions and find out how science underpins the way your garden grows.

• Plant Promenade
The Garden’s majestic Main Walk will be hosting local
independent nurseries with choice plants for sale.

• Meet the Family
Learn all about plant families in the Garden’s unique Systematic Beds. Experts will be on hand to explain the key differences between plant families and invite visitors to pull apart some flowers and use the structures to determine which plants belong together and build a family tree. 

Fantasy Flowers & The Fairyland Trust
There’s lots for younger visitors to do from dreaming
up fantasy flowers to plant out and making garlands with our visiting flower fairies.

'Grow your own' giveaways
Local garden centre, Scotsdales, will be in the Schools’ Garden helping you to join the ‘grow your own’ revolution, no matter how small your plot.

• Tour table
The Tour Table is the meeting point for a selection of expert-led tours of the collections and plants that are looking their best in mid-May – the tree collection, the wildflowers, the Systematic Beds, bee plants, and an introduction to the Garden’s National Collections.

• Glasshouses
In the Glasshouses, visitors can travel around the world, discovering the drama of plant diversity supported by habitats ranging from rainforests to deserts. Garden guides will be on hand to answer questions and share plant curiosities such as the giant Coco de Mer, the largest seed in the world. The new Tropical Wetlands house featuring giant South American waterlilies will be officially opened, offering the chance to find out all about life in hot water.

This event is part of International Fascination of Plants Day, an initiative led by the European Plant Science Organisation (EPSO), and supported by the Cambridge Partnership for Plant Science and the Sainsbury Laboratory Cambridge University. 

So whether it’s getting advice on which plant goes where or how to home compost, discovering the inner workings of flowers, picking up some unusual plants for the garden, or simply having a fun day out with the family, there’ll be something for everyone at the Botanic Garden’s Festival of Plants.
