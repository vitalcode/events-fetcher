JLS Foundation OJAM

The JLS Foundation's inaugural flagship event, taking place this Summer.
JLS are proud to present OJAM, a brand new event that promises to be one of the hottest dates in London’s social calendar in 2013. Full of unique JLS surprises, energy and electrifying performances, this is set to be a very special event.
 
OJAM will bring together some of JLS’ closest and most well-known friends, along with 500 hand selected guests creating a celebration to remember.
 
The evening will begin with a Champagne and cocktail reception, followed by an outstanding fine dining experience with a twist. The legendary Jonny Gould will then provide a highly entertaining and energetically charged Grand Auction.  

The evening will culminate in a live concert which will be headlined by Gary Barlow and include some very special joint appearances.

The event will be in aid of the JLS Foundation and through this event, they hope to raise over £500,000 for Cancer Research UK and fund research into cancers that affect children, teenagers and young adults.
