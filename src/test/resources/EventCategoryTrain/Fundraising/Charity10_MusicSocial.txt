Sound & Vision

Cancer Research UK's heritage music event at the legendary Abbey Road Studios celebrates music and the imagery it inspires.
Sound & Vision is Cancer Research UK’s unique heritage music event celebrating music, the people who make it and the imagery it inspires.  

Guests are treated to intimate performances from some of the world’s leading musicians and music legends, an exclusive rock ‘n’ roll photography exhibition and a live auction.  

The event was originally established by world renowned music producer Sir George Martin who famously discovered The Beatles. We are also privileged to have BBC Radio 2 legend ‘Whispering’ Bob Harris OBE as a co-patron.
