Dallaglio Foundation 8Rocks

An exclusive and unique fundraising dinner in November to raise funds for Cancer Research UK
In November 2013 the Dallaglio Foundation will once again host 8Rocks, an established event in London’s social calendar.  8Rocks launched in 2009, with Lawrence Dallaglio hosting 600 specially invited guests at an sensational evening of unrivalled hospitality at Battersea Evolution, London.
 
To date, 8Rocks has raised nearly £2.4 million for the Dallaglio Foundation. This funds Cancer Research UK’s crucial work of improving the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.
 
With world-class entertainment, exceptional service and typically inaccessible fundraising opportunities, 8Rocks is an exciting event that C-level corporates have always wanted to be a part of. Lawrence has created an incredible party full of leaders of industry, celebrities and Dallaglio Foundation corporate partners and has managed to put the fun back into fundraising.
 
The Dallaglio Foundation funds the prostate cancer arm of a new cutting edge project which seeks to understand more about the genetic faults behind prostate cancer. It will help us begin to understand why it is such a variable disease, changing treatments for cancer patients in the future. 

 
8Rocks is an invitation-only event but if you or your company would like to be involved in 2013's event then please contact the Foundations team at Cancer Research UK for more information.
