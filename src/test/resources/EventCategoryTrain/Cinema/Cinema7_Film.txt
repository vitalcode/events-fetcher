Iron Man 3 (12A)


Synopsis

Marvel's armour-plated icon returns for the thrilling third instalment in the blockbusting franchise. Everyone's favourite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back! The flippant hero with a heart of gold now faces his greatest threat yet. It arrives in the form of deadly master-criminal The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) - a villain who sets about destroying Stark's entire world. Out on his own, Stark must rely on ingenuity to defeat his arch-nemesis whilst fighting to protect the love of his life, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). But does he have the mettle to survive The Mandarin's plan and rise up as Iron Man once more? Following the gigantic success of the previous two Iron Man movies and Avengers Assemble, expectations for this third entry are soaring higher than the hot-rod hero himself. Famed Lethal Weapon writer Shane Black takes over as director for what promises to be Iron Man's most thrilling, emotional and action-packed ride yet.
