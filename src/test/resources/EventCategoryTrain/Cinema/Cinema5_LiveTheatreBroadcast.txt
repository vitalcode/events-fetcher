Synopsis
 
Helen Mirren reprises her Academy Award-winning role as Queen Elizabeth II in the highly anticipated West End production of The Audience, broadcast as part of NT Live.
For 60 years, Elizabeth II has met her prime minister in a weekly audience at Buckingham Palace. A meeting like none other in British public life, it is entirely private. Both parties have an unspoken agreement never to repeat what is said – not even to their spouses.
The Audience breaks this contract of silence and imagines a series of pivotal meetings between the prime ministers and their Queen. From Churchill to Cameron, each prime minister uses these private conversations as a sounding board and a confessional. Sometimes intimate, sometimes explosive, the private audiences chart the arc of the second Elizabethan Age. Twelve politicians have come and gone through the revolving door of electoral politics, but from young mother to grandmother, the Queen remains constant, waiting to welcome her next prime minister.
The Audience reunites writer Peter Morgan and Academy Award-winning actress Helen Mirren, following their collaboration on the critically acclaimed movie sensation THE QUEEN.
The Audience is directed by Academy Award-nominated director Stephen Daldry (BILLY ELLIOT, THE HOURS), and is presented in the West End by Matthew Byam Shaw for Playful Productions, Robert Fox and Andy Harries.
