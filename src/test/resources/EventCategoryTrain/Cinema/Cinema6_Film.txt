Fast and Furious 6 (12A)



Synopsis

Vin Diesel and the team are back for the sixth instalment of the fender-bending franchise! At the end of the blockbusting Fast Five, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew ended up with an impressive $100 million following their daredevil Rio heist. The latest film picks up with Toretto and the others scattered across the world, unable to return home and forever forced to live on the lam. But they're about to be brought back together by their old nemesis Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). Hobbs has been tracking a ruthless unit of road-based mercenaries across 12 countries. And their leader (Luke Evans) is unexpectedly being aided by a significant familiar face. Hobbs realises that the only way to outsmart the villains is to assemble Dominic and his crew to take the baddies on at street level. In return, they will be granted full pardons. Brace yourself for yet more gravity-defying stunts, hot women and exotic locations!
