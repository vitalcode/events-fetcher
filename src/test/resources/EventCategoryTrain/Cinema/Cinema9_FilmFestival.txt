In his first feature since directing and starring in the dark, Oscar-nominated crime caper THE TOWN, Ben Affleck repeats the feat with a very different drama, this time based on real events.

The film follows the Revolutionary Guards’ 1979 attack on the US embassy in Tehran and the subsequent hostage crisis. A thickly bearded Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA ‘ex-filtration’ specialist charged with rescuing six of his countrymen who have been holed up in the Canadian embassy.

ARGO firmly establishes Ben Affleck as a director of uncompromising commitment who, together with first-time scriptwriter Chris Terrio, has delivered one of this autumn’s most talked-about features, and one of which co-producer George Clooney – another highly principled filmmaker – can be justifiably proud.
