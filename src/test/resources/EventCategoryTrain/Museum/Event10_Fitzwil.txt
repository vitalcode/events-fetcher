Museums at Night

Join us for a special evening and explore the collections after hours. Listen out for live music across the site with modern music on the outside lawn; folk, pop and world in the galleries and jazz next to the Courtyard Café - open late. Dip into short talks from Fitzwilliam staff about the art they love, draw copies of artworks in the galleries then make a frame for your picture in our Education studio. There will also be an opportunity to dress up and pose as a painting and take a picture to remember the night!
