Race, Rattle 'n' Roll

Description	Get ready to race, rattle 'n' roll at Ascot's 1950s-inspired race meeting. This is racing with a twist, and the perfect excuse to get together with friends, family or colleagues. 
The Friday night is Ascot’s only evening meeting will have an electric retro atmosphere as the Grandstand is transformed into a chic American diner. Set against a backdrop of classic Cadillacs and ice cream sundaes, racegoers are encouraged to wear 1950s dress. 
The evening consists of six competitive races over distances from five furlongs to two miles. 
On Friday night there will be toe-tapping jive music, with 'guys and dolls' on hand to show you how it's done. Saturday continues with a full slate of Flat racing, followed by more live music and a lively dance floor. 
All entertainment is in the Grandstand Admission area so all can enjoy the 1950s vibe.
