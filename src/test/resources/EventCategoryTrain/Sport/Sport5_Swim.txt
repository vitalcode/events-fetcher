University social club swimming


Each week one lane is opened for the more enthusiastic swimmer. We also set aside a second lane for families, with children who use floats, etc. The middle area is set aside for general swimming, but at a more reasonable pace. If you fancy stopping for a chat, then you can.

Please note that booking is required for this event.
