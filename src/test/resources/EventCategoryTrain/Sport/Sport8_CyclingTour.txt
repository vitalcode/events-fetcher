Cycling, good for you, good for Peterborough

 

What better way to explore the wide expanse of the historic fens and scenic countryside surrounding Peterborough, than by bicycle?

 
Speed through sprawling fields of wheat and amble through the ancient woodlands in the heart of Bretton. Trundle through Ferry Meadows and disturb a Heron into flight or catch a glimpse of blue from the flitting Kingfisher. There are endless beauty spots, but as you pass through Helpston, be sure to stop off at John Clare Cottage, where one of our most remarkable poets of the English Countryside (John Clare) lived for many years.
 
''In the cowslips peeps I lie, 
Hidden from the buzzing fly, 
While green grass beneath me lies, 
Pearled wi' dew like fishes' eyes, 
Here I lye, a clock-a-clay, 
Waiting for the time o' day.''
John Clare (1793-1864), British poet. Clock-a-Clay (l. 1-6)

To the North of Peterborough, along the border of Lincolnshire, flows the River Welland which courses eastwards along the fens. To the south meanders the River Nene, close to the historic centre and Peterborough Cathedral. The Nene Washes provide habitat for wintering bird populations of waders and wildfowl such as Bewick swans, often seen feeding on surrounding agricultural land.
 
One of four environment cities, Peterborough has the vision, enthusiasm and landscape for cycling. Local cycling groups such as the Yaxley Riders, Fenland Clarion C.C. and Ramsey Cycling Club, enjoy the benefits of an extensive network of around 200km of cycle routes, including 11 named and numbered routes. All of which provide a quick, safe and easy way to get around the city. 
 
Linked to these routes is the Green Wheel, a 45 mile long cycle route circling the city. There are plenty of places to stop off at, such as the Crown Lakes, Flag Fen and Ferry Meadows Country Parks, and villages such as Peakirk, Newborough and Farcet.
