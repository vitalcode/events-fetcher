Yoga 4 Pregnancy


About this course

Yoga 4 Pregancy classes run by an experienced teacher trained by the British Wheel of Yoga. In these classes we practise gentle movements, breathing exercises, and relaxation. These will strengthen the body, alleviate the discomforts of pregnancy, and promote relaxation and bonding with the baby. The classes also offer an opportunity to practise positions and techniques for labour and to meet other mothers-to-be. No prior yoga experience is necessary.
