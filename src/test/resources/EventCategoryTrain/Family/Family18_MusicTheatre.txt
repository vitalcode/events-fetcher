Description	This vibrant musical production has all of Kenneth Grahame's Tales of the River Bank, the Open Road, the Wild Wood, the exuberant Mr Toad, Mole, Ratty and Badger. 

Beautifully written, played and produced this show in Image Musical Theatre's immensely popular format gives the opportunity for everyone to take part. Some children play the rabbits, the ducks and the thieving weasels while the whole audience learns the chorus' four songs. 

This is family theatre at its very best.
