Alice in Wonderland

The iconic children's tale Alice in Wonderland weaves an extraordinary world in which up is down, down is up, and nothing is as it appears to be. Penned by Lewis Carroll, the timeless tale follows an innocent young girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole, beginning her incredible journey through another world. Her story was first realized on the stage in 1886, when the celebrated theatrical adaptation debuted in London's West End. Alice in Wonderland brings Carroll's rich world to life in the form of a musical pantomime as Alice encounters singing flowers, a Mad Hatter, a cheshire cat and a temperamental deck of cards.
