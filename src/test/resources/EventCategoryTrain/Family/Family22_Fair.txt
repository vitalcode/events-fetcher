Midsummer Common fair
 
Cambridge’s oldest and biggest travelling fun fair and market.

The fair features some of the best rides including dodgems, roundabouts, rollercoasters and ghost trains, as well as all the usual fun of the fair including candy floss, hot dogs, toffee apples and more. This is a great outing, whatever your age!
