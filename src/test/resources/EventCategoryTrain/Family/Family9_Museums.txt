A light at the museum

If you think museums are dreary, dusty affairs, you clearly haven’t been to the revamped Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. EMMA HIGGINBOTHAM checks out a Viking ironing board, a flying fox loincloth and some very, very old potatoes...

Not so long ago, the words ‘Let’s go to the museum’ were only marginally less horrifying for a child than ‘Let’s go and have your injections’.

Who doesn’t remember traipsing round funny-smelling rooms, peering blankly into wooden cases full of – well, goodness knows what, then staggering out into the daylight, bemused, exhausted and slightly nauseous? The only good bit was the gift shop. Ah, those dinosaur pencils…

Thankfully, museums these days are altogether more engaging – and they don’t get much better than Cambridge University’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA).

Once a rather academic establishment, its recent 18-month makeover has left it light, bright and welcoming. But one thing hasn’t changed: the MAA is still filled with all manner of fascinating objects, from every imaginable time and place.

In fact the very first case – opposite the swish new glass front doors – houses everything from a figure with real human dreadlocks (and a flying fox for a loincloth) to a 1.8 million-year-old tool, via a funny-looking wooden ornament which has become the MAA’s emblem. “We call it ‘Two Men and a Pog’, because we don’t know if this is a pig or a dog,” confides Sarah-Jane Harknett. “There’s still so much to learn…”

Sarah-Jane is the museum’s outreach organiser, and regularly brings the collection to life for groups of pre-schoolers, intrigued teens and people with dementia alike. Infectiously enthusiastic, she’s even hosted children’s sleepovers in the galleries (“exhausting, but good fun,” she says. “They do eventually fall asleep”).

So how does Sarah-Jane, herself an archaeology graduate, explain the ‘ologys’ to a child? “Archaeology is finding out about people by digging things up, and our anthropology collections were mostly collected by going out and speaking to those people,” she says. “That’s the main difference, but they’re both about people.”

Sure enough, the story of man’s journey over the last two million years is told here, with all the objects revolving around birth, daily life and death.

Incredibly, the MAA owns around a million artefacts, of which less than half of one per cent is on display. Cambridgeshire’s rich history means that the ground floor is devoted to local finds, all slipped into ?cleverly-designed glass cases. Relics range from pottery, stained glass and pretty jewellery to delightfully mundane objects such as tweezers, ancient shoe soles and even a Roman make-up pot with scrapings of rouge at the bottom.

This pot will take centre stage tomorrow night, when the museum is hosting an event called Retail Retold. “We wanted to encourage people to come and look at things that are related to their professions,” explains Sarah-Jane. “Some people think that the museum isn’t going to be ‘for them’, so this is a really good way to say ‘Actually it is’.”

Local beauticians have been invited along to check out the rouge (as well as fish-shaped slates used by Egyptians to mix their eyeliner), and the city’s tattooists will view tattoo combs collected by Captain Cook, who first brought body inking to these shores. “The comb would be dipped in ink, and then you’d whack it into the skin with a paddle,” says Sarah-Jane. “Apparently it’s actually less painful than the modern method, but takes longer.”

Meanwhile staff from dry-cleaning companies will examine a nifty Viking ironing board made of whalebone, and ladies from lingerie stores will be shown Maria, a busty (if a little droopy) ‘demon scarer’ statue. “She was very popular with the sailors who brought her over,” says Sarah-Jane. “You can see why.”

Does she have a favourite artefact? “It changes. I’m quite keen on our 500-year-old potatoes, but I get teased about that. I like these,” she says, pointing at some elaborate Anglo-Saxon jewellery. “It’s the original bling, really. And these flints: it’s a shame they’re in a case, I just want to stroke them.” And her favourite era? “The Iron Age. This is probably the worst confession for an archaeologist to make, but I don’t really like the Romans. It’s all a bit too rigid. They build a nice straight road, and they build a fort at the end, which looks like the fort they built at the other end, and it’s all very recognisable.

“With the Iron Age it’s warfare, and revolution, and people doing amazingly intricate, creative, beautiful things. It’s just a fabulous period. And it’s Boudicca! How can you not like charging women?”

A firm favourite with little visitors is the MAA’s female skeleton from Roman Arbury, discovered when the housing estates were built back in the 1950s. They know she was wealthy because of her fancy lead-lined stone coffin: “Arbury was the posh bit then,” reveals Sarah-Jane. “And the bones of a shrew and a mouse were found in with her – they’d nibbled her ankle.

“She is amazing. We don’t know what she died from, probably old age: the scary thing is she was between 40 and 55, which was old for then.”

The skeleton also caught the attention of Sylvia Plath, who wrote a poem about her: “That’s why I call her ‘Sylvia’, and I do confess to saying goodnight to her,” says Sarah-Jane.

The lofty first floor houses the MAA’s anthropology collection (including its magnificent Canadian totem pole, reaching high into the glass roof), while a second floor gallery of archaeology from distant shores overlooks it.

“We often say we have ‘everything, everywhere, ever’,” says Sarah-Jane. “We’ve got things from all over the world, from every place you could think of – and everywhere that you couldn’t.”

It’s certainly somewhere to linger. Check out the Slit Gong, a colossal 12ft wooden musical instrument donated by the Queen, no less (“maybe she already had one,” shrugs Sarah-Jane); peek more closely at the ivory dolls from the Arctic, and you’ll see that one has a baby tucked in her hood; take a closer look at a chief’s headdress from Papua New Guinea, and you’ll spot that its shiny green band is actually made of iridescent beetles’ wings.

“There’s so much to see, and if you really look you can always find something new. I’ve been here 13 years and I never noticed the beetles’ wings in it until this year,” said Sarah-Jane.

2013 is an exciting time for the museum. Not only are they celebrating their centenary on the Downing Street site (after relocating from near Peterhouse), but they’ve also been named as the regional finalist for the Art Fund Prize for Museum of the Year, with £100,000 up for grabs. You can see why the judges fell for it – it really is an amazing place.

But perhaps best of all, at the MAA there’s no pressure to see every object. In fact Sarah-Jane positively encourages flying visits. “I think people feel they have to come and do everything. But why? Particularly with kids – they get so bored,” she said.

“We’re free, and we’re so close to the middle of town, so come for five minutes! Come and look at one thing, go away again, go shopping, and come back next month and look at another thing for five minutes.

“I just want people to leave with the same passion that the staff have. That’s my aim.”

The MAA is in Downing Street, Cambridge, and is usually open Tuesday to Saturday, 10.30am to 4.30pm. Call (01223) 333516 or visit maa.cam.ac.uk

From Saturday to Monday, the MAA will be hosting a free Gala Weekend from 10.30am to 4.30pm each day. Visitors can take part in all manner of activities including the chance to have a go with a full-size medieval catapult, watch a spot of prehistoric butchery, and make everything from bunting to headdresses. Bring a camera, as there’s also a photography competition with an iPad mini to be won.
