Open stages: we welcome everyone to our open stage evenings. Please email us to book a two-song slot if you would like to play as we are usually booked up by the time the evening arrives. For the featured slots we prioritise people who come along to the open stages.
Basement sessions: in the new year we are bringing a new type of evening to CB2, in partnership with Acoustic Routes. The Basement Sessions will feature singer/songwriters Bernard Hoskin, Dave Streatfield, John Meed and Rhys Wilson. For the first half they will perform in the round' taking it in turns to play songs, tell stories and sometimes accompany each other. The second half will open with a special guest and then close with all four musicians playing as a band. You can expect to hear songs by people such as Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, The Band, The Beatles, Elton John, Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Croce and more.
