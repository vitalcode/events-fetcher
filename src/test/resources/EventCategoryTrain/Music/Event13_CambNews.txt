On Friday, May 17 the internationally acclaimed Moscow State Symphony Orchestra visits Cambridge Corn Exchange for the final concert in this year’s hugely successful Cambridge News-backed Classical Concert Series.

All of the concerts in the 2012/13 series have played to packed houses and Moscow State Symphony Orchestra shows no sign of bucking this trend.

The evening opens with excerpts from Rimsky-Korsakov’s exotic Tsar Sultan Suite. Based on a poem by Pushkin, it takes us on a fantastical journey into the fairytale world the composer returned to again and again - think of his famous ‘Flight of the Bumblebee’ in which Prince Guidon is magically transformed into a bumblebee so he can fly back to his father the Tsar, which must surely rank among the most memorable and best loved pieces of classical music ever written.

One of the most accomplished pianists to emerge from Russian in recent years, soloist Tatiana Kolesova gives a bravura performance of Tchaikovsky’s magnificent Piano Concerto No. 1. Born in Moscow in 1985 and a graduate of Moscow Conservatory, Tatiana soon became the laureate of major international piano competitions. She is also a laureate of the Russian President Prize (1997) and was awarded a scholarship of the Order of the Legion of Honour (France), so it is a rare privilege indeed to hear an artist of such international standing perform at the Corn Exchange.

In the second half, the orchestra, under the assured conductorship of Pavel Kogan, brings Tcahikovsky’s great Symphony No. 6 (‘Pathetique’) brilliantly to life. Regarded as the composer’s swan song composition, the symphony ranges across a massive emotional landscape - from its slow, ominous opening to passages of turbulent passion at its climax.

Cases of cholera were rife in St Petersburg in 1893 when Tchaikovsky conducted the première of Symphony No. 6. Five days after conducting this concert, Tchaikovsky made the fatal error of drinking a glass of unboiled water and died four days later at the height of his creative powers aged only 53. Fortunately, concert goers at Cambridge Corn Exchange on Friday, May 17 will be able to enjoy a wide range of soft drinks, beers and wines in the foyer during the interval, secure in the knowledge that no such fate is likely to befall them.
