JEANA LESLIE & SIOBHAN MILLER
Jeana Leslie and Siobhan Miller are two talented young singers and musicians recognised as shining stars on the Scottish folk scene. They are both blessed with lovely, natural voices that blend beautifully, and their performances focus strongly on communicating through traditional, contemporary and self-penned song. 

They came to prominence as winners of the BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award in 2008, which was followed by both the Hancock Horizon Award and Up and Coming Artist of the Year at the Scots Trad Music Awards in 2009. Adding to these accolades, most recently Siobhan was named Citty Finlayson Scots Singer of the Year at the Scots Trad Music Awards 2011. 

Since coming together as a duo in 2008 and experiencing a whirlwind rise to prominence, they have performed extensively throughout the UK and Europe, including many major festivals. Critics and audiences alike have responded warmly to the duo’s fresh approach to vocal arrangements, to their friendly and open, communicative personalities onstage, and to their two acclaimed albums – In a Bleeze (2008), and Shadows Tall (2010). 

Jeana (fiddle, Hardanger fiddle, piano, vocal) was a semi-finalist in the Scottish Young Traditional Musician of the Year Award in 2004 and 2005. Siobhan (vocal, dance) first appeared at the Traditional Song and Music Association of Scotland’s Auchtermuchty Festival when only 13 years old, and won both the children’s and women’s singing competitions. Jeana and Siobhan really know how to bring a song to life! 

Old Blind Dogs band member Aaron Jones will accompany them on guitar and bouzouki.
