Family Art Week at the Fitzwilliam

Create your own works of art to take home or add to our group installation. On each of the three days we will be exploring and experimenting with a different art material, using the Museum’s collections for creative inspiration.

Drop-in anytime between 11.00 – 13.00 & 14.00 – 16.00
