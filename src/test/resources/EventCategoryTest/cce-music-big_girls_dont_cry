Big Girls Don't Cry

Celebrating the music of Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons.
Featuring the Eastcoast Boys.

Oh what a night awaits for all music fans... during the 60s and 70s No1 hits Sherry, December 1963 (Oh What a Night), Walk Like a Man, Rag Doll and Big Girls Don’t Cry saw the Four Seasons and lead singer Frankie Valli propelled to super stardom. Selling an incredible 100 million records worldwide, there’s a Four Seasons song that shares a special place in everyone’s heart.

Big Girls Don’t Cry authentically revives the sublime harmonies of New Jersey’s finest. It showcases Frankie’s incredible falsettos, and features solo hits that range from the exuberant – the rock’n’roll nostalgia of Grease, to the spine-tingling–show-stealers such as My Eyes Adored You. Drawing from a repertoire that includes Let’s Hang On, Working My Way Back to You, Beggin’, Who Loves You and I’ve Got You Under My Skin you’re never more than a song away from another classic hit.
