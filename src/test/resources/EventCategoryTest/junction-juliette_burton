Troopfest is a brand new festival of work encompassing theatre, dance, spoken word, comedy, storytelling, live music made and performed by members of Cambridge Junction’s artist development scheme, Troop.

Each evening presents a double bill of Edinburgh Fringe previews (Trooping North), a brand new ensemble work performed by Troop members created with Nigel Barratt & Louise Mari (This is not a Drill), a ‘curtain raiser’ of short works in progress and extracts (First Manoeuvres), plus other works peppered throughout and outside the building.  A taste of the Edinburgh Fringe on your doorstep.
